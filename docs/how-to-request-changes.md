# How to Request Changes

This guide helps teachers and staff request changes to the Mergington High School Activities website without needing to modify code directly.

## What are Issue Templates?

Issue templates are simple forms that guide you through providing all the necessary information for a change request. When you create a new issue in GitHub, you'll be presented with several template options to choose from.

## Available Templates

### 1. Add New Activity
**Use this when:** You want to add a new extracurricular activity to the system.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Activity name
- Description of what students will do
- Schedule (days and times)
- Maximum number of participants
- Any initial students already signed up (optional)

**Example:** Adding a "Photography Club" that meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30-5:00 PM.

---

### 2. Modify Existing Activity
**Use this when:** You need to change details about an activity that already exists.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Which activity to modify
- What needs to change (description, schedule, max participants, or name)
- The new information
- Why the change is needed

**Example:** Changing Chess Club's meeting time from 3:15 PM to 4:00 PM because of room availability.

### 3. Report a Bug
**Use this when:** Something on the website isn't working correctly.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- What's not working
- What should happen instead
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem
- Any error messages you see
- Which part of the website is affected

**Example:** When trying to register a student for Soccer Team, you get an error message instead of a confirmation.

### 4. Change Website Appearance
**Use this when:** You want to change how something looks on the website (colors, layout, fonts, etc.).

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Which part of the website needs visual changes
- How it looks now
- How you want it to look
- Why the change is needed
- Any color preferences or examples

**Example:** Making activity cards have colored borders based on activity type (blue for sports, green for academic).

### 5. Feature Request
**Use this when:** You want to add completely new functionality that doesn't exist yet.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- What feature you'd like
- Who would use it and why
- How it should work (the user experience)
- How important it is

**Example:** Adding the ability for students to see which of their friends are signed up for each activity.
