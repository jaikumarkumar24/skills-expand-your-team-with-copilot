        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        - The activity information should be updated in the system
        - The changes should be visible on the website immediately
        - Existing participant registrations should remain intact (unless removing participants is part of the request)
        - The activity should still be filterable by the new schedule if changed
        
        ## Implementation Hints
        
        - Update the activity data in `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary
        - If renaming the activity, update the key in the dictionary and the `_id` field
        - Preserve the existing participants array unless specifically asked to modify it
        - Ensure the schedule format matches existing activities (24-hour time as strings)
        
        ## Related Files
        
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Where activity definitions are stored
        - `src/backend/routers/activities.py` - May need updates if changing activity name
        
        ## Important Notes
        
        - Changing an activity name requires updating it everywhere it's referenced
        - Be careful not to lose existing participant data
        - Test the changes by viewing the activity on the website
